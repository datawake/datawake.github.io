            <h2>Intentional linguistics</h2>
            <p>Effective communication begins in the actual words people choose
                to express themselves and motivate each other toward goals &
                objectives. There are 7 categories of possible linguistic
                expression and you can measurably improve both group and
                individual communication by becoming aware of the seven
                categories and coding them into your behavior. The methodology I
                use teaches team members:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>how to become aware of the words you use</li>
                <li>how to understand your communication goals for different
                    situations
                </li>
                <li>how to actively choose & be intentional about the words you
                    use for different communicate goals
                </li>
                <li>how to avoid miscommunication with others through proactive
                    communication
                </li>
                <li>how to avoid miscommunication with yourself by enhancing
                    self-awareness
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Measurable Improvement: the Team Cohesion Metric</h2>
            <p>The Team Cohesion Metric is a measurement of team development and potential for effective group action, quantified as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Clarity of Objectives</i> – are objectives documented & clear for everyone involved, across functions?</li>
                <li><i>Team Integration</i> – are all functions required for successful achievement of the objectives meaningfully engaged on the team?</li>
                <li><i>Roles & Responsibilities</i> – how effectively have R&R been defined and communicated to everyone involved?</li>
                <li><i>Risk Assessment</i> – how effectively has the team assessed potential risk events for both projects and work processes?</li>
                <li><i>Work Process</i> – is there an established work process and how variable are team member perceptions of the requirements and workflow?
                <li><i>Connectedness Profile</i> – what is the level of trust that exists between each team member and at the group level?</li>
                <li><i>Communication Competencies</i> – what is the level of competency at the group level and at the individual levels for intentional linguistics?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each component is rated on a three point scale and the results are weighted into an index that can be used to benchmark current levels of cohesion and measure progress going forward.</p>
            <h2>Examples of Team Development Workshop Agenda Items</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>SWOT analysis</li>
                <li>Lessons learned exercise (with visual & interactive
                    components)
                </li>
                <li>Intentional linguistics presentation</li>
                <li>Email linguistic analysis</li>
                <li>R&R guessing game</li>
                <li>Objectives alignment (facilitated discussion)</li>
                <li>Focused communication analysis</li>
                <li>Trust-building exercises (outdoor, indoor, physical
                    or non-physical)
                </li>
                <li>Improvisational communication exercises</li>
                <li>Exercises that facilitate social connection</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Culture as a Service</h2>
            <p>Human beings are inherently cultural, tribal creatures. This
                evolutionary quality can be both an advantage and disadvantage:
                tribal territorialism often causes communication breakdowns in
                the workplace, but strong tribal cohesion often produces
                incredible, innovative results.</p>
            <p>When we think about organizational transformation from the basic
                approach that subculture workflows are a service to the goals
                greater organization, we can begin to divorce territorialism
                from productivity in practice.</p>
            <p>This type of transformation requires a fundamental paradigm shift
                towards a more dynamic model of governance and functional
                reporting.</p>

            <h2>Information Flow Analysis</h2>
            <p>When a product or project that requires collaboration among a
                group of people is underperforming, it’s because there is a
                problem in the way information is flowing between leadership,
                the people doing the work, and the work process steps they use.
                Manifesting improvement calls for a scientific investigation of
                the information flow: a research study that collects data and
                performs statistical analysis to correlate drivers with
                outcomes.</p>
